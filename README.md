Various MATLAB codes for implementing 
* the sparse representations of matrices CSR and CSC form
* the sparse form of a block Toeplitz tridiagonal matrix
* given a sparse square matrix and a block size create the representations BCCS and BCRS
* given a matrix in BCCS form find the vector y <- y + Ax
and to combine and verify the above.
